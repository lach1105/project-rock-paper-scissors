# Rock Paper Scissors Project
Thsi program allows the user to play the game of Rock Paper Scissors. Classes were built to represent the game and its players.

## Installation
1. Open your preferred terminal program.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Execute the script. Actual syntax for this may vary based upon your operating system and terminal program.

Example using Git Bash on Windows 10:
```
$ python rps.py
```

## Usage
Follow on-screen prompts.
### Player Types
- Random: plays a completely random choice between rock, paper, and scissors.
- Reflect: remembers what move the _opponent_ played last round, and plays that move _this_ round. (In other words, if you play 'paper' on the first round, a ReflectPlayer will play 'paper' on the second round.)
- Cycle: remembers what move it played last round, and cycles through the different moves. (If it played 'rock' this round, it should play 'paper' in the next round.)
